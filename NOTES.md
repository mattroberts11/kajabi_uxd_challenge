# Candidate notes

Add any notes here you'd like for reviewers to see in regard to your challenge submission.
## Notes
- Assuming this is just a componenent so not including other semantic html (ie. main, section etc)
- For the title an H tag may be more appropriate but I used a div so I didn't have to write reset css to clear the H tag's default browser styles
