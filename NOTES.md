# Notes from Matt

Thank you for the chance to show off some of my skills.  I enjoyed this project and I look forward to talking to you about it.
## Notes
- Assuming this is just a componenent so not including other semantic html (ie. main, section etc)
- For the title an H tag may be more appropriate but I used a div so I didn't have to write reset css to clear the H tag's default browser styles
- I set base font size and use rem in some places just to show my understanding of it
- There is an unavailable class that a developer could use to toggle to show a red bar
- I added some very minimal interactivity via hover styles
- I tried to make this card as accessible as possible using aria attributes and a tabindex
-- If you click in the card you can tab to the two interactive items
- Max width set to 688px per Figma width
- I didn't set the min-width
- I made it fully responsive for most device sizes. For it to be perfect on all devices would require some more work. Did not account for padding or margin on parent element for smaller devices.
