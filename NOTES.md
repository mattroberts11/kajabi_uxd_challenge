# Notes from Matt

Thank you for the chance to show off some of my skills.  I enjoyed this project and I look forward to talking to you about it.
## Notes
- Assuming this is just a componenent so not including other semantic html (ie. main, section etc)
- For the title an H tag may be more appropriate but I used a div so I didn't have to write reset css to clear the H tag's default browser styles
- There is an unavailable class that a developer could use to toggle to show a red bar
- I added some very minimal interactivity via hover styles
- I tried to make this card as accessible as possible
- no max width set assuming this would be contained by a parent element
- I made it fully responsive but not down to galaxy fold width of 280px - will look good on most devices.  Did not account for padding or margin on parent element.
